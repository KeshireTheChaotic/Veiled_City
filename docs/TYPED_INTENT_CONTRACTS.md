# Typed Intent Authority Contracts

Accepted typed intents are canonical adjudication inputs; human declarations own intent; native receipts own outcomes.

| Layer or evidence | Authorizes | Never authorizes by itself | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|
| Authenticated human declaration, including an authorized proxy within its role | Voluntary PC/proxy actions, explicit conditions, spoken words, separately verified affirmative consent | Success, unlimited reach/resources, rules exceptions, unintended interior entry | Discord principal and source ledger |
| OpenAI semantic proposal | Candidate meaning, targets, framing, order, and memory relevance | Mutation, consent, objective truth, fabricated player speech, or outcome | GM structured-output producer |
| Validated typed intent | Canonical structured input that native adjudication must process | Resolution, spending, arrival, NPC knowledge, canon, or irreversible agreement | Intent validator and source/actor/referent grounding |
| Native arbitration | Rule basis, accessibility, required roll, verified obstacle, or material clarification | Spending/outcomes without native receipts or scope broader than the declaration | Rule adapters and prospective transaction |
| Committed native receipt | The authoritative occurrence of one specific action outcome | Unrelated facts, omniscience, or secrets outside the authorized audience | DB transaction and idempotency ledger |
| Memory record | Scoped continuity for what was introduced, perceived, said, inferred, promised, or retained | Canon by retention alone, custody/ownership, or knowledge for a different audience | Memory, epistemic, and audience policy |
| Narration | Player-facing depiction of verified resolution and permissible descriptive fiction | A mechanical effect merely because prose describes it | Reconciliation and publication outbox |
| Canon ledger or saved GM ruling | Established setting/rule constraints in its applicable scope | Retroactive consent or alteration outside the allowed human process | Existing canon and ruling services |

## Binding boundaries

- An accepted typed intent is a potentially fallible representation of human-authored intent. Material ambiguity is narrowed or clarified, never silently escalated.
- `approach` is not `enter`; `say` is not `agree`; `handle` is not `own`; `attempt` is not `succeed`; testimony is not objective knowledge; memory is not canon; model resolution is not commitment.
- Preview uses the same native path but rolls back. Dice, costs, movement, consent, canon changes, and exactly-once outcomes require final native commit receipts.
- Memory visibility is inherited from the exact surface that supports persistence. A private/user/character/GM surface cannot be used to promote a public or party record, shared summary, or NPC observation.
- Retrieval must enforce both record audience and active source ancestry. Character-private continuity follows that character and must not leak to another character controlled by the same or another user.
- Narration and model-selected memory relevance never grant NPC witness status or knowledge.

The base matrix records T00/T05a boundaries. The following section records the implemented T01 lifecycle; the broader T05b memory model remains future work.

## T01 authenticated-source and acceptance contracts

- `authored_turn` is the immutable version-1 owner-authored source event. It binds the Discord message, guild, session, scene, user, character, principal revision, audience, raw UTF-8 text and SHA-256 hash before native routing.
- `authored_turn_envelope` is an additive annotation record containing only verified native-consumed raw offset ranges and their receipt references. It cannot rewrite the source event. Overlapping, out-of-range or receipt-free annotations are rejected.
- `semantic_intent_proposal` version 2 is fallible model interpretation. Its stable identity is derived from the authored source event, exact start/end occurrence, actor, type and operation. It stores attempted action, desired outcome and any owner-attributed outcome claim separately. Every new claim begins `unverified`.
- `typed_intent` with status `accepted_for_adjudication` is the native acceptance record. Acceptance rechecks active owner ancestry, principal and scene revisions, exact raw hash/span offsets, audience, immediate framing, consumed-span exclusion and resolved target identity. It has no outcome receipt at acceptance.
- The pre-T01 flat `player_intents` model shape is adapted additively into the version-2 proposal contract. Existing `interpreted` records and `legacy_scene_entry_adapter` receipts remain readable, but historical text never becomes fresh authority.

The authenticated raw source remains available to contextual reasoning even when native handlers consume a clause. The GM receives a separate unconsumed-input view and span ledger; a consumed source occurrence cannot be accepted or executed again. Identical text at distinct offsets is distinct intent, while replay of the same occurrence returns the same proposal and acceptance records.

Accepted typed intents are canonical adjudication inputs; human declarations own intent; native receipts own outcomes.
